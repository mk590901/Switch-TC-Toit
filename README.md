# Switch-TC-Toit

The application tests threaded code generated by the editor of hierarchical state machines. The original scheme can be seen on the __switch_reset.svg__ attached to the project. It's model of a switch affected by two events: __TURN__ and __RESET__. The first switches two states __ON__ and __OFF__, the second resets the state machine to the __OFF__ state regardless of what state it was in before.
